.SH DESCRIPTION

auto-gen-get-set-opaque
generates get (accessor) and set (mutator) macros
and set (mutator) functions for the first structure in the header
file file-private.h.

Each header should define exactly one class structure, following
object-oriented design standards.

The structure should be opaque, meaning that it is defined in
a private header file that is not installed.
file-private.h should define the structure as a tag and include
the API header, file.h, which defines the type.

.nf
// file-private.h, used only by this project and not installed
struct name
{
...
};

#include "file.h"

// file.h, the API header used by dependent software
// Does not define the structure, so other software must use
// the API defined by this project
typedef struct name name_t;
.fi

lib-flags (e.g. -lbiolibc) indicate the require library for the class
and are included in the synopsis.

The header must define constants ${PREFIX}DATA_OK and
${PREFIX}DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE, where PREFIX is taken from the
third command-line argument.

If header files are installed in a subdirectory under
PREFIX/include, then it must be specified as the fourth argument.

.SH RETURN VALUES

0 on success, non-zero error codes otherwise
