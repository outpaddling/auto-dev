.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
file.h              Header file containing the structure def

return-value-prefix Prefix on constants returned by mutator functions

.SH DESCRIPTION

auto-gen-get-set-transparent generates get (accessor) and set (mutator) macros
and set (mutator) functions for the first structure in the header file
file.h.

Each header should define exactly one class structure, following
object-oriented design standards.

This header is assumed to make the structure transparent to
dependent software, i.e. they can see the structure contents.

lib-flags (e.g. -lbiolibc) indicate the require library for the class
and are included in the synopsis.

The header must define constants ${PREFIX}DATA_OK and
${PREFIX}DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE, where PREFIX is taken from the
third command-line argument.

If header files are installed in a subdirectory under
PREFIX/include, then it must be specified as the fourth argument.

.SH RETURN VALUES

0 on success, non-zero error codes otherwise
